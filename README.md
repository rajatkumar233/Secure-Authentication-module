Secure Authentication Module

This Secure Authentication Module provides a robust and flexible solution for securing user authentication processes in web and mobile applications. Designed with security best practices in mind, it ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive resources by integrating advanced techniques such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), OAuth, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), and encryption. The module is customizable, scalable, and easy to integrate with existing authentication systems, making it an ideal choice for developers looking to bolster security without compromising user experience.

Key Features:

    Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Enhance security by requiring multiple verification factors.

    JWT-based Authentication: Secure and stateless authentication with JSON Web Tokens.

    OAuth Integration: Seamless integration with popular identity providers (Google, Facebook, GitHub, etc.).

    Password Hashing: Utilizes modern cryptographic algorithms to securely store user passwords.

    Session Management: Efficient session handling and protection against session fixation attacks.

    Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Manage user permissions and roles to control access to different parts of your application.

This module is perfect for developers who are looking to implement secure, industry-standard authentication mechanisms in their applications. It ensures that user data is protected against common threats and helps maintain trust with users.
